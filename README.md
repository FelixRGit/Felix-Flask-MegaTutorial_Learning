# Welcome to my learning copy of Flask-Microblog!

This is my own copy of the Microblog Flask application provided by Miguel Grinberg - which I use to learn Flask and to familiarzie myself with Github.

This is an example application featured in the from Miguel Grinberg [Flask Mega-Tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world). See the tutorial for instructions on how to work with it.
